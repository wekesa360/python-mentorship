"""
 Write a program using bisection method algorithm to find the root of a quadratic equation.
"""

        # For a given function f(x),the Bisection Method algorithm works as follows:

        #     1. two values a and b are chosen for which f(a) > 0 and f(b) < 0 (or the other way around)
        #     2. interval halving: a midpoint c is calculated as the arithmetic mean between a and b, c = (a + b) / 2
        #     3. the function f is evaluated for the value of c
        #     4. if f(c) = 0 means that we found the root of the function, which is c
        #     5. if f(c) â‰  0 we check the sign of f(c):
        #         1. if f(c) has the same sign as f(a) we replace a with c and we keep the same value for b
        #         2. if f(c) has the same sign as f(b), we replace b with c and we keep the same value for a
        #     6. we go back to step 2. and recalculate c with the new value of a or b

        # The algorithm ends when the values of f(c) is less than a defined tolerance (e.g. 0.001). 
        # In this case we say that c is close enough to be the root of the function for which f(c) ~= 0.
        # In order to avoid too many iterations, we can set a maximum number of iterations (e.g. 1000) and even if we are above the defined tolerance, 
        # we keep the last value of c as the root of our function.
